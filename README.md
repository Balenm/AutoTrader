# AutoTrader - Data Preprocessing, Exploration, Transformation and Feature Selection

AutoTrader is a website that allows users to buy and sell new and used cars. It is an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of cars. Users can search for cars based on a variety of criteria, such as make, model, year, price, registration year, etc. In this project,I will be working on a sample dataset with 10 features, 1 target, and 402,005 observations. The main goal for of project is to build an accurate machine learning model(s) to predict the price of the car. Below is the outline of the steps included:
