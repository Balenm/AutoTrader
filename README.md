AutoTrader is a website that allows users to buy and sell new and used cars. It is an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of cars. Users can search for cars based on a variety of criteria, such as make, model, year, price, registration year, etc. In this project,I will be working on a sample dataset with 11 features and 402,005 observations. Our main goal for this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the price of the car based on the other features. The process I will be taking is to clean the data, generate some insights and to identify the importancy of the features. Below is the outline of the steps taken:


Section 1: Importing and Merging Data
Section 2: Data Preparation and Cleaning
    Some Data Cleaning Techniques
    Handling Missing Values
    Handling Outliers
Section 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
    Correlation of Numerical Features with the Target
    Distribution of the Categorical Features with the Target
Effects of Body Type and Condition of the Car on the Target
    Section 4: Feature Transformation
    TargetEncoder
    Cars with Single Observation
Section 5: Feature Selection
    Multicolliniarity
    Univariate Statistical Test
    Mutual Information Regression (MIR)
